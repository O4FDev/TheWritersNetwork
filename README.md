## Description 

The writers network is a basic story sharing site. It was created by Luke & Conor during 2017-2018 as a start project to web development. When you load this site up using UWamp you'll be able to post stories, create accounts, and login. 

## About the project 

The insperation for this project came from both me and Conor, being strong writers we decided that a site which would act like a game jam for writers would be a great starter project for the both of us. 

A lot of this code can be credited to Conor. I'd estimate about 60% of it, though he's given up the project and passed me back the magical control ball with all the copyright permissions for the code. He won't have an active participation in this project any longer as he's working on Game Development, and I wish him all the best with his future carrer. 

My only request is that if you redistrobute this code you create a fork with your additions in a clear description so others can use it (And follow the GNU Public License 3.0 this git has stored on it). 

## Installation 

You shouldn't struggle to setup the project too much, Conor and I decided to use UWamp for this project. Simly use the MySQL login already in the code and then change the passwords and usernames for obvious reasons. (I'll update this with a step by step guide when I have the time after Cyber First 2020) 

## License Agereement 
 
For the license I selected GNU Public License v3.0. This allows you to redistrobute the code and make changes to it. Generally to find out more just google the license and check out your rights. If you need anymore assistance either contact myself or if it's a big thing contact a lawyer. I am not a replacement for actual legal advice. 

## My vision & ideas 

As I previously stated, The Writers Network is aimed at becoming a sort of GameJam for writers. Anything other than that is fair game. I don't want their to be an all out war on my vision like there is currently on BitCoin, therefore my accounts are very public and I will express my opinions very clearly and merge only the best features with the cleanest code possible. 

## Security Concerns 

The largest concern I have right now is a SQL Injection attack, if this is fixed I will remove this. 

Other than that, if you find a bug report it to my E-Mail lukelucasbusiness@gmail.com or fix it and inform me so I can merge the code.
