<p class='paratext'>
Welcome to the Writers Network. This is an on-going website that we have just begun building. Our project will continue on and on this website you will be able to beta test some of our new features! <br>
On this website there will definetly be multiple bugs. It would be very useful for our team if you would be able to report any bugs to either of these emails. <br>
<br>
conor.thewritersnetwork@protonmail.com<br>
luke.thewritersnetwork@protonmail.com<br>
Keep checking this site as over time new features will roll out. This website doesn't show the point of our website yet or how it will function and that will be announced over social <br>
Medias in January or February 2019. We also wish that you may send us emails if you need any assistance or if you would like to suggest any future features!

<h2 class='title1'>How to use our site</h2>


<p class='paratext2'>
The general idea of our site circles around uploading and reading stories created by you and other authors. We unfortunatly can't go into many details about how we will make it more interesting and fun <br>
for our users yet this will be announced early 2019. This beta (VERSION A) only contains the bare minimum of features we have ready so this version is called, 'PUBLISH AND READ'. We are excited to hear <br>
feedback and \/ you can find a list of instructions on how to use this version.</p>
